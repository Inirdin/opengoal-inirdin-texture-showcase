# OpenGoal-Inirdin-texture-showcase
This mod showcases all texture replacements I did for OpenGOAL. This was created as easy and convinient way to try all the textures in Mod Launcher. There aren't any original textures from the game, I repainted all of them from scratch.

This includes:
- Hot Wheels Zoomer
- Spyro Flut Flut
- Thaww (Ice Klaww)
- Precursor Basin with Eyes
- Ratatouille (Boggy rats as Remy)
- Black Bats
